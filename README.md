## Basic Mechanics
You now get hungry and thirsty over time, and from doing work. Getting too hungry or thirsty gives you de-buffs. Of course, you can alleviate your hunger by eating food, and slake your thirst by drinking beverages (including water from a water source, your watering can, or things like wine, coffee, etc.).

Just remember, what goes in will eventually come out. You now also have to worry about managing your more private needs. The fullness of your bladder and bowels increase naturally over time, given that you're neither starving nor dying of thirst. Be careful not to over eat or over drink though, it'll quickly pass through you! Currently the only toilet is in your house, so if you're out and about, you have a few options:
- Try to hold it and run home (or another toilet) to use the potty like a big boy/girl.
- Pull down your pants and go right where you are. But be warned! If anyone can see/smell you, they may not quite appreciate your 'performance'!
- Go in your pants! Of course, if you want to do that, you may want to consider some protection, available at Pierre's Seed Shop, who is definitely not our sponsor!
  - If you rely too much on your protection, though, you may just find that it becomes a little bit harder to stop yourself. If you even notice, that is.

## Issues and Ideas
Please feel free to ask questions, report bugs, and request features on the GitHub page.

### Issue Report Guidance
Please include the following in the issue report:

#### Issue Description
Try to be as specific as possible. 
- What were you trying to do?
- What did you expect to happen versus what actually happened?
- Where were you and when?

#### SMAPI Log
##### Enable Content Patcher's verbose logging
1. Open SMAPI's smapi-internal/StardewModdingAPI.config.json in a text editor
2. Change `"VerboseLogging": false` to `"VerboseLogging": true`
3. Save the file.

##### Obtain the log
1. Run the game until you encounter the issue.
2. Exit the game.
3. Press the Windows and R buttons at the same time.
4. In the 'run' box that appears, enter this exact text:
5. %appdata%\StardewValley\ErrorLogs
6. The log file is SMAPI-crash.txt if it exists, otherwise SMAPI-latest.txt.

#### Save file
For most bugs, one of the biggest aids is the Save File, as it would help in debugging the reported issue by more easily recreating the prerequisite conditions.
